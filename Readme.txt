Resume:
This codebase is a Java-based implementation of a Pokémon service that retrieves data from the PokeAPI.

Design Decisions:
1. Service-Oriented Architecture to decouple the service (PokemonService) from the data source

2. Reactive programming with streams for efficient data processing and handling

3. REST template for easy and efficient HTTP requests to the PokeAPI

Improvements:
1. Error Handling
The PokemonService class should include error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors that may occur when
making HTTP requests to the PokeAPI. This could include try-catch blocks, error logging, and error propagation.

2. Caching
The PokemonService class could benefit from caching mechanisms to reduce the number of HTTP requests made to the PokeAPI.
This could include using a caching framework like Ehcache or Redis.

3. Testing
The test classes could be improved by adding more comprehensive tests, including tests for error scenarios and edge cases.

4. Performance Optimization
The PokemonService class could be optimized for performance by using parallel processing or asynchronous programming
to retrieve Pokémon data from the PokeAPI.

5. Security
The codebase should include security mechanisms to protect against common web application vulnerabilities.
